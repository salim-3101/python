1. Introduction
 This document outlines the technical specifications for creating a  REST API to monitor requests sent through Vodafone Submitsms SOAP API and fetch the SSID.
 2. Objective 
The main objective of this project is to create an API that can monitor requests sent through Vodafone Sunmitsms SOAP API and fetch the SSID.
 3. Overview 
The API will use JSON as the primary data format for communication, and will have a RESTful API design. It will be responsible for monitoring requests sent through Vodafone Sunmitsms SOAP API and fetching the SSID.
 4. API Endpoints The API endpoints will be as follows: - 
GET /request/{requestID}: This endpoint will be used to retrieve the SSID for a given request ID. - POST /request: This endpoint will be used to submit a request through the Vodafone Sunmitsms SOAP API. 
5. Parameters
 The following parameters are required to submit a request: - RequestID (string): The unique ID of the request - Sender (string): The sender of the request - Recipient (string): The recipient of the request - Message (string): The message to be sent 
6. Authentication
 The API will use basic authentication for all requests.
 7. Response
 The API will return a JSON response with the following structure: 
{ "requestID": "123456789", "ssid": "123456789", "status": "success" } 
8. Error Handling
 The API will return a JSON response with an error code and message in case of an error. The error code will be a HTTP status code. 
9. Rate Limiting 
The API will have a rate limit of 100 requests per minute.
10. Security
 The API will use SSL encryption for all requests. 
11. Documentation 
The API will have comprehensive documentation available online. This will include detailed instructions on how to use the API, a list of all the endpoints, parameters, and response codes.
